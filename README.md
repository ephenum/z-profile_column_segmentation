# z-profile_column_segmentation
for regular manuscripts with regular page layout with matlab

works very well on manuscripts with homogenous layout of n columns. 
Lines can subsequently be segmented with the heartbeat-seamcarve repository: 
https://github.com/ephenum/heartbeat_seamcarve_line_segmentation

The z-profile code requires matlab 2018b and the following toolboxes:
  computer vision toolbox version 8.2
  image processing toolbox version 10.3
  and if you want to use the cnn for the margins
    deep learning toolbox 12.0
you also require the code from the simple binarization repository https://github.com/ephenum/binarization
